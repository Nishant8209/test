# Welcome to Storybook

Storybook is a UI component development tool that allows developers to build, test, and document components in isolation. This helps create robust, reusable components for your React project.

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is a playground for UI components. It helps you:

- **Visualize components in isolation** from the rest of the application.
- **Document components** with examples, props, and usage notes.
- **Test components** visually, functionally, and for accessibility.

With Storybook, you can explore how your components behave under different conditions without needing to launch your full app.

## How to Use This Storybook

1. **Navigate Components**: Use the sidebar on the left to explore all the components in this project.
2. **Interact with Controls**: Many components have configurable options (called controls). You can adjust these controls in the "Controls" panel to see how the component behaves.
3. **Switch Themes or Backgrounds**: Use the toolbar at the top to toggle between themes, backgrounds, and viewport sizes.
4. **Read the Documentation**: Each story contains detailed documentation about the component's purpose, usage, and behavior.

## Key Features of This Storybook

- **Responsive Testing**: View components on different screen sizes.
- **Themes**: Preview components with light and dark modes.
- **Actions**: Test event handlers using the action logger.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Verify compliance with accessibility standards using Storybook's a11y tool.

## Structure of Stories

- **Components**: These are the reusable building blocks of the UI.
- **Stories**: These showcase components in various states or configurations.
- **Docs**: These provide detailed information about the component, its props, and usage.

## Getting Started with Components

To create or update a component:

1. Add your React component file to the appropriate directory.
2. Create a corresponding `.stories.tsx` file in the same directory.
3. Write stories to showcase different states and use cases of the component.

Example:

```tsx
export const Primary = {
  args: {
    label: 'Primary Button',
    className: 'btn btn-primary',
  },
}
```
